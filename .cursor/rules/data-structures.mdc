# Data Structures

## Users Collection

```typescript
interface User {
  displayName: string;
  email: string;
  lastFmUserName: string;
}

// Example User Document
{
  displayName: "Biggs",
  email: "biggsy@pm.me"
  lastFmUserName: "biggzen"
}
```

### Field Descriptions

- `displayName`: User's display name in the application
- `email`: User's email address
- `lastFmUserName`: Last.FM username

## Playlists Collection

```typescript
interface Playlist {
  playlistId: string;          // Spotify playlist ID
  name: string;               // Playlist name from Spotify
  type: 'known' | 'new';
  category: 'queued' | 'curious' | 'interested' | 'great' | 'excellent' | 'wonderful';
  priority: number;    // Arbitrary number for flexible ordering (e.g. 10, 20, 25)
  userId: string;      // Reference to the user's document ID
  createdAt: timestamp;
  updatedAt: timestamp;
}

// Example Playlist Document
{
  playlistId: "spotify-playlist-id",
  name: "Known Interested",
  type: "known",
  category: "wonderful",
  priority: 20,
  userId: "user123",
  createdAt: timestamp,
  updatedAt: timestamp
}
```

### Field Descriptions

- `playlistId`: The Spotify playlist ID
- `name`: The name of the playlist from Spotify
- `type`: Indicates if the playlist is for known or new artists
- `category`: The rating category of the playlist
- `priority`: Arbitrary number used for flexible ordering within categories
- `userId`: Reference to the user who owns this playlist
- `createdAt`: Timestamp when the playlist was created
- `updatedAt`: Timestamp when the playlist was last updated

### Notes
- The `priority` field can be any number, allowing for flexible ordering (e.g. 10, 20, 25)
- Playlist metadata (name, images, etc.) is fetched from Spotify API on demand
- Composite index required on `userId`, `type`, and `category` for efficient querying

## Albums Collection

```typescript
interface PlaylistHistoryEntry {
  playlistId: string;
  playlistName: string;
  category: 'queued' | 'curious' | 'interested' | 'great' | 'excellent' | 'wonderful';
  type: 'known' | 'new';
  priority: number;
  addedAt: timestamp;
  removedAt: timestamp | null;
}

interface UserAlbumData {
  playlistHistory: PlaylistHistoryEntry[];
  createdAt: timestamp;
  updatedAt: timestamp;
}

interface Album {
  albumTitle: string;
  artistName: string;
  userEntries: {
    [userId: string]: UserAlbumData;
  };
}

// Example Album Document
{
  // Document ID is the Spotify album ID
  albumTitle: "Album Title",
  artistName: "Artist Name",
  userEntries: {
    "user123": {
      playlistHistory: [
        {
          playlistId: "playlist789",
          playlistName: "Playlist Name 1",
          category: "curious",
          type: "known",
          priority: 10,
          addedAt: timestamp,
          removedAt: timestamp
        },
        {
          playlistId: "playlist456",
          playlistName: "Playlist Name 2",
          category: "interested",
          type: "known",
          priority: 20,
          addedAt: timestamp,
          removedAt: null  // null indicates this is the current playlist
        }
      ],
      createdAt: timestamp,
      updatedAt: timestamp
    }
  }
}
```

### Field Descriptions

- `albumTitle`: The title of the album
- `artistName`: The name of the artist
- `userEntries`: Map of user IDs to their album data
  - Key: User's document ID
  - Value: User's data for this album
- `playlistHistory`: Array of playlist entries showing the album's progression
  - `playlistId`: The Spotify playlist ID
  - `playlistName`: The name of the playlist
  - `category`: The rating category of the playlist
  - `type`: Whether this was a known or new artist
  - `priority`: Number used for ordering within the playlist
  - `addedAt`: When the album was added to this playlist
  - `removedAt`: When the album was removed (null if current playlist)
- `createdAt`: When this album was first added to the system
- `updatedAt`: When this album's data was last modified

### Notes
- Document ID is the Spotify album ID
- Current playlist is indicated by `removedAt: null` in the playlist history
- Each user can have their own independent history with the album
- No need for composite indexes as queries are by album ID

## Album Mappings Collection

```typescript
interface AlbumMapping {
  alternateId: string;  // The alternate Spotify album ID
  primaryId: string;    // The primary Spotify album ID to use
  createdAt: timestamp;
  updatedAt: timestamp;
}

// Example AlbumMapping Document
{
  alternateId: "1CZJ60gPKnIYtSKtygtPPM",
  primaryId: "62Um6FQA9X4aFVdfatLpHB",
  createdAt: timestamp,
  updatedAt: timestamp
}
```

### Field Descriptions

- `alternateId`: The alternate Spotify album ID that should be mapped
- `primaryId`: The primary Spotify album ID that contains the playlist data
- `createdAt`: When this mapping was created
- `updatedAt`: When this mapping was last modified

### Notes
- Used to handle cases where Spotify changes an album's ID
- Allows maintaining playlist history when album IDs change
- Requires composite index on `alternateId` for efficient querying
- Any authenticated user can create, read, update, and delete mappings
- All operations require proper data structure with alternateId and primaryId fields
